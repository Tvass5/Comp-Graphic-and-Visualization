# How do I approach designing software?
- What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

When working on my project it helped me to craft my conceptualization and visualization skills.

- What design process did you follow for your project work?

When working on my project I made sure to understand the project requirements and user needs before I started. 

- How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

One tactic from my design approach that could be applied to future work is my tactic of trial and error. I believe that process would be very helpful in any future projects that Im working on whether job related or personal.

# How do I approach developing programs?
- What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

One new development strategy that I used while working on my 3D stage was brraking up my deliverables. Breaking my tasks into smaller sections allowed me to focus on completeing each on of my objects in my 3D scene.

- How did iteration factor into your development?

Iteration played a huge role in my project development as developing the object vertices involved alot of repetitive work. I had to code various vertices for each object in order to create the desired 3D image.

- How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

My approach to developing code evolved very well throughout the milestones, as with each milestone completed I was able to learn and understand more and more about OpenGL. It became alot easier for me to understand how to read, write and interpret the code every week. I believe that each milestone contributed in some way to my final project.
